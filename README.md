# Hackathon
Inspiration: We wanted to create a robot, and we all love rock, paper, scissors, so the idea was born from this inspiration.

What it does: Bot Paper Scissors is a robot that you can play rock, paper, scissors with. All you have to do is simply move your hand across the motion sensor and then the robot will challenge you to a nice, "friendly" game of rock, paper, scissors!

How we built it: We used the Arduino Uno and created code to move the motors in the correct direction and at the correct speed. We were able to upload our code to the Arduino which was connected to the two L298N motor boards. We also included a motion sensor and created code to activate the game once the sensor was triggered. The motion sensor included a potentiometer for us to control how sensitive it is and we were able to mess around with this to our liking as well.

Challenges we ran into: We ran into some challenges with one of the L298N motor boards. It took us a few hours to figure it out, however, we were able to debug everything and realize that the board was the problem. We tried replacing the motors, the wires, and other components, but once we concluded to replace the board (and waiting for another board to be available), we were able to continue with our project.

Accomplishments that we're proud of: We are very proud of our project and we are honestly surprised that we were able to do this. We haven't worked with an Arduino Uno before, but we were happy to be able to create this game and we hope others enjoy it as well!

What we learned: We learned how to work as a team and to be able to code our Arduino to control the motors. For this team, we really didn't know how we were going to go about everything, however, we were able to figure it out.

What's next for Bot Paper Scissors: The next steps include improving the design to be able to complete an actual product that can be used by others. We also would like to hide all of our hardware inside a bigger version of the robot.

Built With: arduino-uno, keeyees-motor-drivers, and stemedu-motion-sensors
